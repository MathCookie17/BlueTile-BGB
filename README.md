# Board Game Builder

## Project Overview
This **Board Game Builder** is a tool that allows users to design and play custom turn-based board games. Users can define:
- Board shape and size
- Custom pieces and their movement rules
- Tile events and special conditions
- Win conditions and turn order

This project aims to produce a **general-purpose game builder** where users define rules using a simple **"if this then that"** scripting language. Completed games are saved as **JSON files** that can be reloaded for future play. Unlike other board game builders online that provide only the graphics and physics simulations, our project has enforceable rulesets rather than relying on the honor system.

Currently, the project does not have any form of LAN or server hosting, so when playing a game with multiple people, you'll need to pass around a single device or use some form of screen sharing.
